# TabTracker
\n Made with the FreeCodeCamp Vue JS videos on Youtube.

#Guitar Tablature Tracker - Yes there are plenty of resources out there for Guitar tabs, but this is my take, and slight spin of the project. The code is similar but there have been alterations made in order to not plagerize the tutorial and Cody's work. 

This is a full stack application. using Sql, Express, Vue, and Node. 

#TODO:#
Server Visualization for SQL
